      <description>When working on a machine learning problem, if you want to improve your algorithm&#39;s performance, there a a lot of choices to choose from. So its very important to filter out the best possible choices to try for your current problem.
Orthognalization The process of tuning one parameter/ hyperparameter at a time, such that its effect is independent to other parameters/ hyperparameters is called Orthognalization.
A machine learning project have several goals (as listed below).</description>

      <description>Train/ Dev/ Test Sets  Train Dev/ Cross-Validation Test   Small Data 70% 15% 15%   Big Data 98% (1 million) 1% (10,000) 1% (10,000)   In real world application, we often do not have enough data and our models are data hungry. Its alright to collect Train data from multiple sources (e.g. Web Scraping when actual application deals with photos takes from a phone camera) and can be different from distribution different from dev/ test sets.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning refers to training of Deep Neural Networks (neural networks with several hidden layers).
Deep Neural Networks basically automate the feature extraction step.

Neural Networks Takes input features, figures out functions to map it to output. Most commonly used function for this mapping is called ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function.
